This is not the first time I try to start a blog. Not even the second nor third. Yet, it's the **first time** to do a blog about code and product development. 

In this humble blog I will be writing and sharing with you: 

- Open-source libraries I develop.
- Libraries found around Github (I usually fork them!)
- Share links to interesting reads I've been doing recently on product development.

So, you're all very welcomed to this blog, and hopefully you'll find it interesting enough to share your thoughts on the material I'll be sharing :)
